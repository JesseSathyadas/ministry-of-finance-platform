# Environment Variables Setup

## Required Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following:

```bash
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

# CRITICAL: Required for Admin User Creation
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
```

## How to Get These Values

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **API**
3. Copy the following:
   - **Project URL** → `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - **anon/public key** → `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - **service_role key** → `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` ⚠️ **Keep this secret!**

## Why SERVICE_ROLE_KEY is Needed

The service role key allows the admin to:
- Create users without email confirmation
- Bypass Row Level Security (RLS) for admin operations
- Assign roles directly to new users

**Without this key, admin user creation will fail.**

## Security Notes

- Never commit `.env.local` to git (it's in `.gitignore`)
- The service role key has full database access - keep it secure
- Only use it in server-side code (Server Actions, API Routes)
